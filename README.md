# EventBite

### General Idea
A simple app to search for an event in town and easily find a restaurant nearby

### Target Audience
Event-goers who want to meet up somewhere afterwards and grab a bite

### Primary Problem
Searching restaurants nearby event centers requires multiple searches or even multiple apps

### Primary Goal
Provide a single location to find a restaurant nearby whatever event you are/will be attending

### Identify and prioritize user stories
As a concert-goer, I sometimes want to grab a bite to eat with friends after an event  
As a concert-goer, it would be nice to have the option to easily plan ahead where to eat before an event
