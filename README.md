# EventBite
---
**General Idea**<br>
A simple app to search for an event in town and easily find a restaurant nearby

**Target Audience**<br>
Event-goers who want to meet up somewhere afterwards and grab a bite

**Primary Problem**<br>
Searching restaurants nearby event centers requires multiple searches or even multiple apps

**Primary Goal**<br>
Provide a single location to find a restaurant nearby whatever event you are/will be attending

**Identify and prioritize user stories**
* As a concert-goer, I sometimes want to grab a bite to eat with friends after an event  
* As a concert-goer, it would be nice to have the option to easily plan ahead where to eat before an event
